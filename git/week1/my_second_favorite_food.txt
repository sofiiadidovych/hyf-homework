The best homemade margherita pizza begins with homemade pizza dough. Homemade pizza dough may sound difficult to you. Why waste the time when you can just buy frozen pizza dough? Well, here’s a fact: Homemade pizza dough has a delicious flavor and texture that only comes from YOU!

Pizza Dough Ingredients
Here’s my recipe for homemade pizza dough. There’s only 6 ingredients, plus some water.

Yeast: Instant yeast makes the job quicker.
Water: Use warm water to reduce the rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is too hot.
Flour: It’s best to use unbleached all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which reduces the amount of water the flour can absorb.
Oil: Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor. Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.
Salt & Sugar: Salt adds flavor and sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough.
Cornmeal: Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan; it gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.
Margherita Pizza Toppings
Despite how I feel about loading up on pizza toppings, less is more when it comes to margherita pizza. Plain, simple, and easy, margherita pizza is fulfilling without too much grease weighing it down. There are only 4-5 ingredients on top of the pizza dough.

For absolute best flavor, use homemade roasted garlic.
Use your favorite homemade tomato sauce.
Top with good quality mozzarella.
And fresh juicy tomatoes, any size.
Plus lots of fresh basil. And bonus if the basil is from your garden.
Garlic, juicy tomatoes, and fresh basil also taste wonderful on top of homemade focaccia!
